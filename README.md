# SnakeGame
Two versions of the famous Snake Game, made with Python Turtle and Pygame
## Instructions
Use your arrowkeys to change the direction that the snake moves. Once you start the game the snake will not stop, and you cannot move in the opposite direction of the current direction. Try to eat as much food as you can by touching it with the head, and make you snake grow, but if you touch the edges, it's game over!

Enjoy!
